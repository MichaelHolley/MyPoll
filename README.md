# MyPoll
MyPoll is Full-Stack application based on a ASP.NET Core Backend with a Angular + Bootstrap Frontend, which allows any user to create simple polls with multi-selection and optional answers.

## Disclaimer
This application was created within 10 hours as part of a training project and is therefor missing a lot of features.

## Prevent duplicate votes
To prevent a user from voting twice I have added a logic to remember already answered polls in a list inside local-storage. This is not save, but a client-side quick solution.
